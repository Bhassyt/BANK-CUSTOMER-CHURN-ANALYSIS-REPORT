## Project Overview
---
In the competitive banking industry, customer retention is paramount for sustained growth and profitability. Customer churn, the rate at which customers switch banks, poses a significant challenge. Analyzing churn patterns offers insights to retain existing customers and attract new ones. This project aims to comprehensively analyze bank customer churn using data-driven approaches.

## Data Sources
---
The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is the "bank_customer_churn_data.xlsx" file. The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **Customer ID:** A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname:** The customer's surname or last name.
- **Credit Score:** A numerical value representing the customer's credit score.
- **Geography:** The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany).
- **Gender:** The customer's gender (Male or Female).
- **Age:** The customer's age.
- **Tenure:** The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance:** The customer's account balance.
- **NumOfProducts:** The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card).
- **HasCrCard:** Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **IsActiveMember:** Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **EstimatedSalary:** The estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited:** Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no).

The dataset aims to determine customer churn, enabling banks to anticipate and prevent customer attrition. By determining churn, banks can proactively retain customers and reduce turnover rates. This facilitates the implementation of targeted strategies to enhance customer retention, fostering long-term profitability in the competitive banking sector.
